## Course Description

Welcome to the age of the agent orchestrator. Codex is a cloud-based AI agent for software development. Once connected to a GitHub repository, it can automate tasks like fixing bugs, refactoring code, generating tests, and reviewing pull requests. It runs in an isolated environment, writing and testing code based on natural language prompts. Developers can use “ask” mode to get architectural insights or “code” mode to apply concrete changes. Codex executes shell commands and validates its work against test suites, producing clean, review-ready diffs. It transforms tedious engineering work into repeatable workflows powered by intelligent automation.

Learning objectives
- Configure Codex to work with a GitHub repository.
- Learn to use prompts to ask questions about your code.
- Prompt the AI to make changes and tackle new features.
- Execute bug fixes and code reviews through natural language prompts.
- Working with diffs and follow-up suggestions.
- Apply Codex to automate repetitive tasks such as refactoring and test generation.
